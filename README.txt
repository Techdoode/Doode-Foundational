== Using rem values ==
When you look at the style.css file you will notice that a majority of the values use rem (root em). The following tool helped determine the needed rem value:

*To input a value for these divs, you can use px if that is what you are comfortable with. It is, however, recommended to use rem values to set the width of these divs.

== Installation ==

Since this theme is still in the initial development stages, it is highly recommended that you only install it on a develpment machine.  Setting up a development environment is beyond the scope of this README.  

1. Set up a development environment on your local machine.  We suggest using LAMP (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_%28software_bundle%29) on a Linux machine, WAMP (http://www.wampserver.com/en/) on a Windows machine, or MAMP (https://www.mamp.info/en/) on an Apple machine.
